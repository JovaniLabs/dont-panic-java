"Problem to Solve"


"You’re a trained “pentester.” After your success in an earlier operation, a new company has hired you to perform a penetration test and report the vulnerabilities in their data system. This time, you suspect you can do better by writing a program in Java that automates your hack.

To succeed in this covert operation, you’ll need to…

Connect, via Java, to a SQLite database.
Alter, within your Java program, the administrator’s password.
If you don’t have experience with Java, not to worry! This problem will walk you through each step along the way."


"Specification"


"In Hack.java, write a Java program to achieve the following:

Connect, via Java, to a SQLite database.
Alter, within your Java program, the administrator’s password.
When your program in Hack.java is run on a new instance of the database, it should produce the above results.

Clock’s ticking!"
